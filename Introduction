This project is an AI-powered Automated Head Count and Attendance Tracking System designed for students in educational institutions. The system utilizes facial recognition technology by the Deep Face library and computer vision for efficient and accurate tracking of attendance by students. It captures and verifies faces in real-time to ensure reliable identification and does away with the manual processes. Attendance records are also logged with timestamps, which makes it easy to manage data. It is scalable, secure, and adaptable to the needs of an institution to streamline attendance monitoring while enhancing classroom management.
